SQL Learning Progress & Daily Practice ‚Äì README
Welcome to my SQL Learning Progress repository!
This repo documents my daily hands-on journey mastering SQL, database concepts, and data engineering skills, especially using Microsoft SQL Server 2022. I‚Äôm currently a trainee at Kasmo Digital, building foundational and advanced skills for real-world data challenges.

üéØ Learning Objectives
Become proficient in SQL query writing: DDL, DML, joins, unions, constraints, aggregate and window functions

Systematic practice with sample business tables (Customers, Orders, Products, Payments, etc.)

Explore type conversion, string, numeric, mathematical, and datetime functions

Apply real-life scenarios including database normalization and data warehousing concepts

üóÇÔ∏è Repo Structure
/daywise/ ‚Äì Daily uploaded SQL scripts and queries

/reference/ ‚Äì Schema definitions, example tables, and template queries for practice

/notes/ ‚Äì Concept explanations, error troubleshooting, and interview questions
