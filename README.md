SQL Learning Progress & Daily Practice – README
Welcome to my SQL Learning Progress repository!
This repo documents my daily hands-on journey mastering SQL, database concepts, and data engineering skills, especially using Microsoft SQL Server 2022. I’m currently a trainee at Kasmo Digital, building foundational and advanced skills for real-world data challenges.

🎯 Learning Objectives
Become proficient in SQL query writing: DDL, DML, joins, unions, constraints, aggregate and window functions

Systematic practice with sample business tables (Customers, Orders, Products, Payments, etc.)

Explore type conversion, string, numeric, mathematical, and datetime functions

Apply real-life scenarios including database normalization and data warehousing concepts

🗂️ Repo Structure
/daywise/ – Daily uploaded SQL scripts and queries

/reference/ – Schema definitions, example tables, and template queries for practice

/notes/ – Concept explanations, error troubleshooting, and interview questions

/ScenarioBased/- Example queries based on BikeStore database and sakila database which cover all of the major functions in SQL

You can refer below Databases for working with those queries:

**Bikestore database** - https://github.com/ShaidHasanShuvo/Bike_Stores

**Sakila**- https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila

🚀 Learning Plan
1. SQL Basics & Database Fundamentals

Creating/modifying tables (DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DROP)

Data manipulation (DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

2. Practice Queries (Step-by-step)

Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER, CROSS)

Unions & Set operations

Constraints (Primary, Foreign, Unique, Check)

Aggregate queries (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)

Mathematical & Numeric functions (ROUND, CEILING, FLOOR, etc.)

String functions (UPPER, LOWER, CONCAT, SUBSTRING)

Date & Time functions (GETDATE, DATENAME, etc.)

Type conversion (CAST, CONVERT, TRY_CAST, etc.)

3. Advanced SQL

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, OVER(), PARTITION BY)

Subqueries & CTEs

Group By, Order By, Having clauses

Error handling and troubleshooting

4. Data Engineering Concepts

Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)

Data warehouse basics: stages, schema, ETL overview

Real-life interview questions and scenarios

5. Continuous Updates

I upload and document my daily practice – you can follow my journey and access all code files to learn with me!
